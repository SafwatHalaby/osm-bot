This is the source code repo for my [OpenStreetMap scripts](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SafwatHalaby).
The scripts automatically edit [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about).
The code is written in Javascript, and is meant to be run using [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) by installing the [JOSM Scripting Plugin](https://gubaer.github.io/josm-scripting-plugin/).
It can be considered a semi-automatic bot; Runs and uploads must be done manually.

# Documentation

Please see my [OSM User Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SafwatHalaby), and the inline code comments.

#Dependencies

There are no special dependencies. 

The script requires the [JOSM Scripting Plugin](https://gubaer.github.io/josm-scripting-plugin/), therefore [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/), therefore Java 8.

Internally, the scripting plugin appears to be using Mozilla Rhino.
