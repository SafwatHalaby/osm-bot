This is the source code repo for my [OpenStreetMap scripts](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SafwatHalaby), which is a bot that edits [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about). The bot is written in Javascript, and is meant to be run using [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) by installing the [JOSM Scripting Plugin](https://gubaer.github.io/josm-scripting-plugin/). It is a semi-automatic bot; Runs and uploads must be done manually.
